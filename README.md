# Solidity Smart Contract

## Description

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates simple error handling techniques to ensure that certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner.

## Usage

Deploy the compiled contract on an Ethereum development network or testnet using tools like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.

## Functions

- **onlyOwner():** Restricts access to the function to only the owner of the contract.
- **ownerHere():** Throws an error if the caller is not the owner.
- **Owner():** Uses the `assert` statement to ensure the caller is the owner.

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented using the `require`, `revert`, and `assert` statements to ensure that only the contract owner can execute certain functions. If a non-owner attempts to call these functions, an appropriate error message is provided.
